# Node Modules

Usually Front-end dependencies are managed by `npm` (more about it in the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)). By default, `npm` installs all dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

Every projects lists all its dependencies, required packages and relevant scripts in its respective `package.json` file.

- Projects and libraries code should never have `node_modules` folder committed.
- Any Project code should commit the `package-lock.json` file. This file is automatically generated for any operations where `npm` modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or the `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
